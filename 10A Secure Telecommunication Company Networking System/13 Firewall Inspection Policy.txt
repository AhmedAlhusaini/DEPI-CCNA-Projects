After Creating Firewall Security Zones , Traffic should follow policy to be enabled between different zones.

Before configuring the Traffic Policy => We must Enable NAT to allow traffic or translating traffic between inside private resources to public one.

Then Configure Default Static Route
======================
This is sth like ip helper 

The default static route ensures that any traffic not destined for your local network is forwarded to the next-hop router. This is essential for internet connectivity or external traffic routing.


The default static route handles traffic that does not match any specific routes in the router's routing table. Here are some examples of "not destined" traffic:

Example 1: Internet Traffic
Imagine you have a network with internal routes defined for subnets like 192.168.10.0/24 and 10.20.0.0/16. Any traffic heading to websites on the internet (e.g., 8.8.8.8 or 192.0.2.1) won't match the defined internal routes. The default static route ensures this traffic is sent to the next-hop gateway for internet access.

Example 2: Unknown External Networks
If a user in your network sends data to an external IP address, like 172.16.100.50, which is not part of your internal network or explicitly routed, the default static route forwards this traffic to the gateway that can reach unknown networks.

Example 3: Misconfigured Devices
Suppose a device in your network tries to send packets to an unintended destination (e.g., an IP address that doesn't exist in your routing table). The default static route helps redirect this traffic to a gateway instead of dropping it.

In essence, the default static route is like a "catch-all" rule to ensure traffic doesn't get lost when no specific route matches its destination. 

Use the following command in global configuration mode:
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [next-hop IP address or outgoing interface]

route OUTSIDE 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 197.200.100.2





Then Configuring Traffic Policy Control
===============================
To control and filter traffic passing through the firewall, you need to use Access Control Policies and other inspection mechanisms. Here's how you can proceed:
a. Access Control Lists (ACLs)
	access-list 101 permit tcp any any eq 80
	access-list 101 deny ip any any

Then, apply the ACL to the appropriate interface:
access-group 101 in interface [interface-name]




access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit icmp any any 

access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit udp any any eq 67 
access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit udp any any eq 68 

access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit udp any any eq 53
access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit tcp any any eq 53

access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit tcp any any eq 80
access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit tcp any any eq 8080
access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit tcp any any eq 443
access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit tcp any any eq 8443

access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit tcp any any eq 25
access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit tcp any any eq 110
access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit tcp any any eq 143

access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit tcp any any eq 445
access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit tcp any any eq 21

access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit udp any any eq bootps
access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit udp any any eq bootpc
access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit tcp any any eq domain
access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit tcp any any eq domain
access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit tcp any any eq domain

access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit udp any host 10.10.10.5 eq 67
access-list INSIDE-DMZ extended permit udp host 10.10.10.5 eq 68 any

access-group INSIDE-DMZ  in interface DMZ
wr mem


b. Inspection Rules ; For advanced traffic control, use Modular Policy Framework (MPF) for features like traffic inspection. Example steps:

Define a class map to identify traffic:
class-map http-traffic
match access-group 101
Define a policy map to apply actions (e.g., inspect traffic):
policy-map http-policy
class http-traffic
inspect


Apply the policy map to a service policy:
service-policy http-policy interface [interface-name]


c. QoS and Bandwidth Control ;To prioritize certain traffic or limit bandwidth usage, configure Quality of Service (QoS) policies.
