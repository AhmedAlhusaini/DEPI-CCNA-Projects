Always begin with studying case studies, gathering requirements to determine conceptual & Logical design.
Determine layers of design & technology of each layer.

Also Determine the VLANs, Subnets, physical design, servers & Network components specs & types

IPs, CIDR , Private & Public IPs  => IP Ranges & number of Users

What kind of services that will be available in this network infrastructure 
Categorize VLANs / Services 
ACL over designs 
================================

Cloud System Compoents ( AZure ) :
	*  VM, blob storage, networking, and security among others to ensure seamless business continuity. The proposed network should allow the team access to these resources. 



########################################################
Due to security requirements, it has been decided that all LAN, WLAN, and VoIP users will be on a separate network segment within the same local area network.  That means Vlans will combine similar users via connection methods not only vlan numbers 
########################################################
The company will be using the following IP address: 
	10.20.0.0/16 for WLAN, 
	192.168.10.0/24 for LAN, 
	172.16.10.0/24 for Voice, 
	10.10.10.0/28 for DMZ and 
	197.200.100.0 for public addresses.
