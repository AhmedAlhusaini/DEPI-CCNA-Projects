We will create only two pools :
1. For LAN = Wired Users 
	Excluding Gateway IP and Broadcast IP
	may be upon need to exclude others 

2. For WLAN = Wireless Users 

This is done on the server not in the Router
**********************************************

Under normal circumstances, we have an access point. Each access point is assigned to a specific department and configured within a separate VLAN. We then set up the IP helper, ensuring that each end device connected to the access point receives an IP address from the available pool without any issues.

Now, what if we only have one VLAN for Wi-Fi and need it to span across the entire department? In such cases, a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) becomes necessary.

So, we config WLC -> Management 
Then assign 
WLC IP
DNS 
Others 


Then In DHCP / AD Server :
add in Pool Config --> WLC IP
