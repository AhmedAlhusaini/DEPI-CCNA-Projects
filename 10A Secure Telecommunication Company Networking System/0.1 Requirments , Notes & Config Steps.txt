-- VoIP is not connected here in case study to firewall , so we add MLS

-- Some Devices are not the same in real world , we keep the same concepts with those aviable in packet tracer

-- Here We follow in vlan different approach , at least it is the first time to me is to configure Vlans based on way of connections not the departments.  I mean LAN , WLAN , ..etc 

-- When configuring a firewall in network setups like Packet Tracer, the terms "inside," "outside," and "DMZ" refer to security zones, and each serves a specific purpose in maintaining network security.
Here's a breakdown:

Inside Zone:

This is the most trusted zone, typically representing the internal network of an organization (e.g., LAN).

Devices in this zone, such as employee workstations, are trusted and have unrestricted access to internal resources.

Traffic moving from the inside zone to other zones (e.g., outside) is often allowed with minimal restrictions.

Outside Zone:

This is the untrusted zone, representing the public internet or external networks.

Traffic from this zone to the inside zone is highly restricted, requiring strict policies to protect internal systems.

Firewalls scrutinize incoming traffic from the outside zone for potential threats.

DMZ (Demilitarized Zone):

This is a semi-trusted zone, often hosting public-facing services such as web servers, email servers, or DNS servers.

The DMZ acts as a buffer zone between the trusted internal network and the untrusted external network.

It allows external users (e.g., customers or clients) to access these services without directly exposing the internal network.

Traffic between the DMZ and the inside zone is restricted and closely monitored.
