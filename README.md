# CCNA/CCNP Infrastructure Projects

Welcome to My CCNA/CCNP Infrastructure Projects Repository! 🌐  
This repository showcases a collection of networking projects completed throughout my learning journey, starting with self-study and advancing through various courses and prestigious scholarships, including:

1. **Eng Ahmed Nabil YouTube Course**
2. **Eng Hassan Shamkh YouTube Course**
3. **DEPI Scholarship**
4. **Guru Network YouTube Channel**

These projects span a wide range of topics, from foundational concepts to advanced infrastructure strategies, providing step-by-step labs and exercises. Each project is meticulously documented, requiring no additional setup—just dive in, learn, enhance your skills, and share your progress with me at [ahmedalhussainy@gisoverflow.com](mailto:ahmedalhussainy@gisoverflow.com) or [ahmdlhoseny@gmail.com](mailto:ahmdlhoseny@gmail.com).

## ℹ️ Disclaimer

This repository also sometimes touches on Esri ArcGIS Enterprise system design and infrastructure recommendations, providing a comprehensive understanding of both networking and GIS infrastructure.

### **Don't Feel Overwhelmed! Use the SQ4R Study Strategy 📖**

To effectively navigate through the study materials, I recommend using the **SQ4R** method. This structured approach enhances comprehension and retention:

1. **S – Survey**: Quickly scan through the material to get an overview.
2. **Q – Question**: Formulate questions about the topics you are about to study.
3. **R – Read**: Read actively while looking for answers to your questions.
4. **R – Recite**: Summarize what you learned in your own words.
5. **R – Review**: Go over the material periodically to reinforce your learning.
6. **R – Reflect**: Connect the new knowledge with what you already know.
