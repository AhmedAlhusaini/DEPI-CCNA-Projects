## ‚úÖ 3. Implementation Notes & Constraints

### ‚õî Constraints

- Centralized network in a single building
- Only one Internet provider (risk of ISP downtime)
- Use of physical and virtualized servers requires advanced planning
- Entire solution must fit a single building footprint (3 floors)  
- Google Cloud used for offsite backup and service hosting  
- No redundant ISPs currently ‚Äì Airtel dependency  
- VoIP system must be high-quality and secure

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks

- VLAN sprawl if departments increase
- Misconfiguration of DMZ may expose critical systems
- OSPF loops if passive interfaces not properly set
- ISP Failure = complete loss of WAN  
- Improper VLAN control = traffic flooding  
- DMZ exposure if firewall misconfigured  

### üîé Key Considerations

#### üîÅ Redundancy:
- Dual links between floors using EtherChannel (LACP)
- HSRP between L3 switches for gateway redundancy
  - HSRP between 2 Core L3 Switches
  - Dual Power Supply Switches, UPS support
  - Load balancing with LACP uplinks

#### üì∂ Segmentation:
- Each VLAN maps to a separate IP subnet , VLAN-based isolation for VoIP, WiFi, Servers, Staff
- DMZ services completely isolated with ASA Firewall rules

#### üìà Scalability:
- Subnets are /23 or larger to allow growth
- IPsec VPN supports cloud expansion
  - Use `/22` for LAN ‚Üí room for 1024 hosts  
  - `/24` subnets for smaller segments  
  - Recommend SD-WAN for multi-site future growth 

#### üß© Challenges:
- Ensuring VoIP QoS across switches
- Inter-VLAN routing configuration on 3850 switches
- Secure firewall NAT and ACL logic


## ‚úÖ 4. Configuration Steps

### üõ†Ô∏è Device Initialization

```bash
hostname CoreSwitch1
enable secret cisco123
line vty 0 4
 password cisco123
 login
 service password-encryption
banner motd ^Authorized Access Only^
```

---

### üì° VLAN Setup on Switch

```bash
vlan 10
 name Management
vlan 20
 name StaffLAN
vlan 30
 name VOIP
vlan 40
 name GuestWiFi
vlan 50
 name DMZ
vlan 60
 name WLC_Uplink
```

---

### üåê Inter-VLAN Routing (Layer 3 Switch)

```bash
interface vlan 10
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
interface vlan 20
 ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.254.0
interface vlan 30
 ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0
...
ip routing
```

---

### üîÑ HSRP Setup

```bash
interface vlan 20
 standby 1 ip 192.168.20.254
 standby 1 priority 110
 standby 1 preempt
```

---

### üîê Security Configuration

```bash
spanning-tree portfast default
spanning-tree bpduguard enable
ip dhcp snooping
ip dhcp snooping vlan 20,30
ip arp inspection vlan 20,30
```

---

### üåê OSPF Routing

```bash
router ospf 1
 network 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0
 passive-interface default
 no passive-interface vlan 10
```

---

### üî• ASA Firewall Zones

- Inside: VLAN 10, 20, 30  
- DMZ: VLAN 50  
- Outside: ISP interface

ACL Example:

```bash
access-list OUTSIDE_IN deny tcp any any eq 22
access-list OUTSIDE_IN permit tcp any host 192.168.50.10 eq 443
```

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Observations and Recommendations During Implementation

### üß≠ Adjustments Made

- Replaced router-based routing with multilayer switch OSPF
- Increased subnet sizes to support device growth (/23)

### üí° Best Practices

- Use SSH for all remote device access
- Maintain VLAN naming consistency across switches
- Implement logging on ASA for VPN and traffic events

### üîÆ Future Enhancements

| Type      | Recommendation | Why |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| Immediate | Enable ASA logging | Troubleshoot VPN/DMZ issues |
| Short-Term | Add redundant Internet link | Reduce ISP downtime risk |
| Long-Term | Implement SD-WAN | Enhance remote/cloud optimization |

### üìö Documentation Importance
- Maintain records of all VLANs, subnets, device configs, and change logs
- Every device config must be backed up  
- Changes must be tracked for audits  
- Use version control (e.g., GitLab Wiki or SharePoint)
