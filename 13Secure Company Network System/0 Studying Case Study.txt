Always begin with studying case studies, gathering requirements to determine conceptual & Logical design.
Determine layers of design & technology of each layer.

Also Determine the VLANs, Subnets, physical design, servers & Network components specs & types

IPs, CIDR , Private & Public IPs  => IP Ranges & number of Users

What kind of services that will be available in this network infrastructure 
Categorize VLANs / Services 
ACL over designs

## **11. Verification & Testing Plan**

### **Testing Plan**

| Test 					| Step 					       		| Expected Outcome | Troubleshooting 			   |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------		|------------------|-----------------			   |
| **1. Inter-VLAN Routing** 		| Ping across VLANs via default gateway on MLS 		| Success 	   | Check VLAN interfaces, routing 	   |
| **2. DHCP/DNS** 			| Clients receive IPs and resolve domain names 		| Success 	   | DHCP scope, DNS server check 	   |
| **3. Site-to-Site VPN** 		| Remote branch connects to HQ resources       		| Tunnel up 	   | Check IKE/ESP settings 		   |
| **4. Firewall Rules** 		| Internal clients can’t reach DMZ resources directly   | Denied packets   | Verify ACLs, zone policies 	   |
| **5. VoIP** 				| IP phones register and make calls 			| Dial tone 	   | Check VLAN, DHCP Option 150, CME      |
| **6. WLAN** 				| Users connect via WLC and APs 			| Connected        | Check WLC config, DHCP, IP addressing |

## **Logical Order of Configuration**

1. Configure Core Switches (VLANs, interfaces, inter-VLAN routing, OSPF)
2. Configure Access Switches (Access ports, VLANs, STP)
3. Setup DHCP/DNS/AD servers (IP, roles)
4. Configure Firewalls (Interfaces, zones, policies)
5. Configure ISP Routers and test internet
6. Setup WLC and register APs
7. Setup VoIP Gateway and phones
8. Implement ACLs, security, and PortFast/BPDUguard
9. Implement HSRP and EtherChannel
10. Test, verify, document
