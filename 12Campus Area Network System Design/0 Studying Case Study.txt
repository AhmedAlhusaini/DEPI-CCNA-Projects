Always begin with studying case studies, gathering requirements to determine conceptual & Logical design.
Determine layers of design & technology of each layer.

Also Determine the VLANs, Subnets, physical design, servers & Network components specs & types

IPs, CIDR , Private & Public IPs  => IP Ranges & number of Users

What kind of services that will be available in this network infrastructure 
Categorize VLANs / Services 
ACL over designs

  - EtherChannel (LACP) for link aggregation.  

---

 4. Servers System Components and Services  
- Server Hardware: 2x physical servers for virtualization.  
- Virtualization: Hypervisor for multiple VMs (DHCP, DNS, etc.).  
- Hosted Services:  
  - DHCP (redundant servers), DNS, FTP, WEB, Email, SMTP in DMZ.  
- Storage Solutions: Not specified (assume SAN/NAS for scalability).  

---

 5. Cloud System Components and Services  
- Cloud Platform: Google Cloud.  
- Cloud Services: Hosting university resources globally (e.g., LMS, email).  

---

 6. Security System Components and Services  
- Firewall: Cisco ASA 5500-X (per campus); DMZ at main campus.  
- Access Control:  
  - Standard ACL for SSH (restricts access to Senior Engineer’s PC).  
  - Security zones/policies on ASA.  
- Network Segmentation:  
  - Separate VLANs for LAN/WLAN/VoIP/DMZ.  
- Additional Security:  
  - BPDUguard, STP PortFast.  
  - IPsec VPN for site-to-site encryption.

| WLAN        		| 192.168.10.0/24          | 50          | Wireless management  |  
| LAN (Main)  		| 10.10.0.0/16             | 20          | Main campus LAN      |  
| LAN (Branch)		| 10.11.0.0/16             | 20          | Branch campus LAN    |  
| Voice (Main)		| 172.16.0.0/16            | -           | VoIP                 |  
| Voice (Branch)	| 172.17.0.0/16            | -           | VoIP                 |  
| DMZ         		| 10.20.20.0/27            | -           | Server farm          |  
| Public (Main)		| 105.100.50.0/30          | -           | ISP connectivity     |

 9. Additional Notes & Recommendations  
- Scalability: Design supports doubling users by 2025 (subnet ranges allow expansion).  
- Redundancy: HSRP, dual DHCP servers, EtherChannel.  
- Future Tech: Consider SD-WAN for improved VPN performance.  
- Performance Testing: Test failover (HSRP, VPN), VLAN routing.  
- Documentation: Maintain diagrams, IP schemes, and security policies.  

---

 10. Basic Settings & Configuration  
- Hostnames: Configured per device (e.g., CoreSW-Main, ASA-Branch).  
- Passwords: Encrypted passwords, SSH-only for remote access.  
- Banner Messages: Configured for legal warnings.  
- Inter-VLAN Routing: Enabled on multilayer switches (tested).  
- Other Settings:  
  - OSPF on firewalls/switches.  
  - Static IPs for servers, DHCP for endpoints.  
- Final Testing:  
  - Verify VLAN communication, VPN tunnel, DHCP assignments, firewall policies.

 Key Observations  
- Strengths: Hierarchical design, redundancy, clear segmentation.  
- To Improve:  
  - Add IDS/IPS for deeper security.  
  - Document cloud integration specifics (Google Cloud ↔ On-prem).
