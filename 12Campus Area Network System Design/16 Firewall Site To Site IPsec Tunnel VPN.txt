The Ultimate Goal Is To Encrypt The Traffic Between Site To Site while passing two ISPes
====================================================================================================
Step 1:-  Create Crypto Ikev1 Policy

In this step, we will configure the HAGLE information.
Hash, authentication, group, encryption must be the same on both sides.


Step 2:- Create A Tunnel-Group To Specify A Pre-Shared Key For Peer.
The pre-shared key should be the same on both sides
To create a tunnel group, there are two steps :
Create tunnel-group

then 
Specify pre-shared key in tunnel-group


Step 3:- Create IPsec Transform-Set

Step 4:- Define Interesting Traffic ACCESS-LIST
Traffic which we want to secure via VPN that is Interesting traffic (192.168.1.1 and 192.168.2.1)
Step 5:- Create A Crypto Map
It is used to create a particular list of VPN ACCESS-LIST, TRANSFORM-SET, and PEER IP.

Step 6:- Enable IKEV1 And Apply Crypto Map On The Interface

Step 7:- Apply Same Steps For Branch 2 ASA Device
Ip addresses will not same. Make sure to use the correct IP addresses for Branch2 ASA.



As you see here network size almost same , what if they are different 
The pure concept behind VPN ACLs when dealing with different network sizes is ensuring that only the required traffic flows securely between sites. Let me break it down:

Concept 1: Define What Needs to Communicate
If HQ has 10 VLANs and Branch has only 2 VLANs, you have to decide:

Which networks at HQ should communicate with Branch?

Which networks at Branch should communicate with HQ?

Do all HQ VLANs need access to Branch, or only specific ones?

Since VPN ACLs control traffic passing through the tunnel, you must only allow relevant subnets.


Concept 2: Access-List Should Match Available Networks
Each site should configure matching ACLs based on subnets it owns.

Example Scenario
HQ: VLANs 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100

Branch: VLANs 10, 60

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
HQ VPN ACL
//////////////////////

access-list VPN-HQ permit ip 172.16.0.0 255.255.255.0 172.17.0.0 255.255.255.0  ! LAN VLAN HQ ↔ Branch
access-list VPN-HQ permit ip 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0  ! MGT VLAN HQ ↔ Branch
crypto map CMAP match address VPN-HQ

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Branch VPN ACL
//////////////////////
access-list VPN-BR permit ip 172.17.0.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.0.0 255.255.255.0  ! LAN VLAN Branch ↔ HQ
access-list VPN-BR permit ip 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0  ! MGT VLAN Branch ↔ HQ
crypto map CMAP match address VPN-BR


oncept 3: Traffic Filtering & Security
Restrict Unnecessary Access:

Don't allow all VLANs to connect—only the needed ones.

Consistency in ACLs:

HQ and Branch must mirror ACLs (HQ permits Branch, Branch permits HQ).

Use Subnet Mask Correctly:

If Branch has only VLAN 10 & 60, HQ shouldn't use permit ip any any.


Final Thoughts
ACLs define what traffic is encrypted & sent through VPN.

You must list only the VLANs that need to communicate.

Each site should permit ONLY the relevant subnets, not the full network.
