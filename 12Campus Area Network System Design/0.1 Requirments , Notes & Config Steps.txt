Here's the detailed extraction and analysis of the Martin Luther King University case study using the structured prompts:

---

 1. Requirements Extraction  

# Business Requirements  
- Support 30,000+ users (scaling to 60,000 by 2025).  
- Centralized IT management from the main campus.  
- Secure access to DMZ servers (DHCP, DNS, FTP) for branch campus users.  
- Global resource delivery via Google Cloud integration.  

# Technical Requirements  
- Hardware:  
  - 2x Cisco ASA 5500-X firewalls (one per campus).  
  - Core: 2x Catalyst 3850 48-port switches per campus.  
  - Access: Catalyst 2960 48-port switches per faculty.  
  - Wireless: Cisco WLC + Lightweight APs (LAPs).  
  - Servers: 2x physical servers for virtualization.  
- Software:  
  - Hypervisor for VMs (unspecified type).  
  - Google Cloud for external services.  
- Protocols:  
  - VLANs: 10 (Management), 20 (LAN), 50 (WLAN), 199 (Blackhole). 
   	- Use subnetting to allocate IPs for WLAN, LAN, Voice, Management and DMZ segments.
   	- Configure inter-VLAN routing using multilayer switches for communication.
  	- Establish high availability and failover with HSRP.

  - Routing: OSPF on ASAs and multilayer switches.  
   	- Integrate Cisco ASA Firewall for enhanced security with inspection policies.
  - Redundancy: HSRP, EtherChannel (LACP).  
  - Security: IPsec VPN, ACLs, BPDUguard.  
- User Demands:  
  - VoIP for all departments (IP phones).
  	- Ensure VoIP telephony services using the Cisco WAN Router.  
  - WiFi coverage per faculty (centrally managed).

 2. Implementation Notes & Constraints  

# General Notes :
   - For WLC, instead of connecting to any of MLS that will limit redundancy , we will connect WLC to Switch and this witch will be connected to both HSRB
   - For MLS, sometimes is missing FastEither Ports , you must add manually 
   - Will implementing this topology be smart and prepare a chunck of some combined devices and then copy paste to another and also config this end devices ( printer , pc , ..etc ) to use DHCP and power on and other primitive settings
   - ALso while working on this topology, use fixing ports for specific tasks, this will also make the config easier :
		So for example here : in access layer switches from:
			Port 1-2 --> For MLS 
			port 3-12 --> LAN / Wired Devices 
			port 12 -14 --> Management Vlan ( In one Switch , otherwise from 3-14 for LAN ) 
			port 15 - 18 --> ArcGIS Enterprise Vlans ( App , webserver , data , database & serverside )
			port 18- 20 --> For VoIP
			Port 21-24 --> Access Points / WLAN 
			ports gig or any unused ports --> blackhole vlan 

# Constraints  
- Distance: 100-mile separation between campuses → Reliance on IPsec VPN (potential latency).  
- ISP Dependency: Single ISP (Airtel) per campus → No WAN redundancy.  
- DMZ Security: Main campus hosts DMZ; branch accesses it via VPN (exposure risk).  

# Key Considerations  
- Redundancy:  
  - Dual DHCP servers (Active Directory).  
  - HSRP for default gateway failover.  
- Segmentation:  
  - Strict VLAN separation (LAN/WLAN/VoIP).  
  - Blackhole VLAN (199) for unused ports.  
- Scalability:  
  - /16 subnets for LAN/Voice allow growth.  
  - Recommend SD-WAN for future VPN optimization.  
- Each department requires sufficient bandwidth, especially for guest WLAN traffic.
- Secure access to Google cloud services for developers and applications.
- Compliance with standards for data security and privacy.

# Challenges  
- Inter-VLAN Routing: Complex on multilayer switches (requires L3 interfaces).  
- QoS: VoIP traffic prioritization not specified (potential voice quality issues).  
- Ensuring user growth projections are supported without performance degradation.
- Managing separate segments for LAN, WLAN, Management and VoIP securely.
- Maintaining redundancy in case of component failure.

 3. Step-by-Step Configuration Guide  
	# Topology & Beautify 
	# Basic Config 
	# VLAN Setup  
	# Subnetting 
 		 - WLAN: 10.10.0.0/16
  		 - LAN: 192.168.0.0/20
  		 - Voice: 172.16.0.0/20
   		 - DMZ: 10.20.20.0/26
	# Inter-VLAN Routing ( OSPF , Virtual Interfaces & Assign Static IPes For Server Rooms ) 
	# Wireless Configuration
      	# ASA Firewall  & Security Policies
      	# HSRP for Default Gateway Redundancy  
      	# IPsec VPN (Site-to-Site)  
      	# Security Hardening

 4. Observations and Recommendations During Implementation
	- Regularly test backup systems and failover mechanisms to minimize downtime risks.
	- Monitor bandwidth usage on WLAN to prevent congestion due to guest or corporate user activity.
	- Document all configurations, especially OSPF and firewall policies, for reference during troubleshooting.
	- Consider future integration of AI-driven network monitoring for proactive issue detection.

# Adjustments Made  
- Used firewalls as routers (no dedicated routers).  
- Allocated /16 subnets despite initial over-provisioning.  

# Best Practices  
- Standardization: Consistent VLAN IDs across campuses.  
- Security: Disabled unused ports (Blackhole VLAN), encrypted passwords.  

# Future Enhancements  
- Immediate:  
  - Implement QoS for VoIP traffic.  
  - Enable NetFlow/sFlow for traffic monitoring.  
- Long-Term:  
  - Migrate to SD-WAN for better VPN performance.  
  - Deploy IDS/IPS for DMZ traffic inspection.  

# Documentation  
- Tools: NetBox for IPAM, Lucidchart for topology diagrams.  
- Process: Document all ACLs, VLANs, and IP schemes in a central wiki.

 Key Takeaways  
1. Design Strengths:  
   - Hierarchical topology with clear redundancy (HSRP, EtherChannel).  
   - Future-proof subnetting (/16 ranges).  
2. Risks:  
   - Single ISP → Recommend adding a backup ISP.  
   - No QoS for VoIP → Potential call drops during congestion.  
3. AI Suggestion:  
   *"Consider automating VLAN provisioning with Cisco DNA Center for scalability."*
