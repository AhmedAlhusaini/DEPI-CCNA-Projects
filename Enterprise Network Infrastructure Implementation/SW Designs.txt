When designing a network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer, you typically include access switches and distribution switches. Let's break down their roles:
- Access Switches:
    - Purpose: Access switches are the first point of connection for end devices (such as computers, printers, phones) in a local area network (LAN). They provide connectivity to the end devices.
    - Functionality:
        - Port Density: Access switches have multiple ports (usually Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet) to connect end devices.
        - VLAN Assignment: They assign VLANs to the connected devices, allowing traffic separation and management.
        - Layer 2 Switching: Access switches perform Layer 2 switching within the same VLAN.
        - Security: They can enforce security policies (e.g., port security, MAC address filtering).
    - Example: When you connect your laptop to an Ethernet port in your office, that port is likely connected to an access switch.
- Distribution Switches:
    - Purpose: Distribution switches aggregate traffic from multiple access switches and connect them to the core network or other distribution switches.
    - Functionality:
        - Aggregation: They aggregate traffic from access switches and route it toward the core network.
        - VLAN Routing: Distribution switches perform inter-VLAN routing, allowing communication between different VLANs.
        - Quality of Service (QoS): They prioritize traffic based on QoS policies.
        - Redundancy: Distribution switches often have redundant links for high availability.
    - Example: In a multi-building campus network, distribution switches connect access switches in each building to the central core.
Remember that this is a simplified explanation, and real-world networks can be more complex. Cisco Packet Tracer allows you to create topologies with routers, switches, and end devices, simulate their behavior, and practice configurations. It's a valuable tool for learning and preparing for Cisco certifications like CCNA. If you'd like, I can help you set up a basic topology in Packet Tracer! ðŸ˜Š
