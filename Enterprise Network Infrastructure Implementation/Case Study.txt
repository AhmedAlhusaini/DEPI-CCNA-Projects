Case Study: Enterprise Network Infrastructure Implementation
Background
XYZ Corporation is a rapidly growing company with multiple departments including Sales, Engineering, HR, and Management. The company is expanding its operations and requires a robust, scalable, and secure network infrastructure to support its business activities. The IT department has been tasked with designing and implementing this network.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:

Segment the network using VLANs to improve security and manageability.
Ensure high availability and redundancy using HSRP.
Provide dynamic IP address allocation using DHCP ( ON ROUTER OR ON SERVER ).
Enable domain name resolution with a DNS server.
Implement OSPF for efficient routing within the network.
Configure PAT/NAT to allow internal devices to access the internet.
Establish BGP peering with the ISP for external connectivity.
Implement additional security measures and remote access capabilities.




Tasks
Configure VLANs:
Create VLANs for different departments: Sales (VLAN 10), Engineering (VLAN 20), HR (VLAN 30), and Management (VLAN 40).
Configure Distributed Switches:
Set one switch as the root primary and another as the root secondary based on HSRP status.
Configure HSRP:
Implement HSRP on Distribution Switches to provide redundancy and ensure network availability.
Configure DHCP Server:
Set up a DHCP server on the routers to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices in each VLAN.
Configure DNS Server:
Set up a DNS server to resolve domain names for internal and external resources.
Configure OSPF:
Establish OSPF routing between Distribution Switches and Routers to ensure efficient data routing.
Configure PAT/NAT:
Set up PAT/NAT to allow internal devices to access the internet and configure a public Web server.
Configure BGP:
Establish BGP peering with the ISP using a unique router IP to ensure external connectivity.
Optional Tasks
ACL Configuration:
Implement an ACL to ensure VLAN 10 in AS 300 cannot reach the Web server in AS 100.
DHCP Snooping:
Configure DHCP Snooping to enhance network security.
Remote Access:
Set up Telnet for remote access to network devices.
