Hereâ€™s the analysis for the given case study based on the applied prompt:

---

### **Requirements**
1. **Business Requirements**:
   - Ensure secure and efficient communication across all floors.
   - Allow scalability to accommodate the projected doubling of users by 2025.
   - Safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive healthcare data.

2. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Implement VLANs to segment LAN, WLAN, and VoIP traffic:
     - VLAN 10 for LAN
     - VLAN 50 for WLAN
     - VLAN 99 for VoIP
   - Use subnetting to allocate IPs for WLAN, LAN, Voice, and DMZ segments.
   - Integrate Cisco ASA Firewall for enhanced security with inspection policies.
   - Configure inter-VLAN routing using multilayer switches for communication.
   - Establish high availability and failover with HSRP.
   - Use OSPF for dynamic routing and efficient network performance.
   - Implement Cisco Packet Tracer for network design testing and simulation.
   - Ensure VoIP telephony services using the Cisco WAN Router.

3. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - **Switches**: 2 Catalyst 3850 (48-Port), 8 Catalyst 2960 (48-Port), and 2 Catalyst 2960 (24-Port).
   - **Routers**: Cisco WAN Router, Catalyst 2811 Router for telephony services.
   - **Servers**: 2 HP ProLiant DL38 Gen10 for virtualization with failover support.
   - **Firewall**: Cisco ASA 5500-X Series for network security.
   - **Storage**: NetApp devices for resource storage.
   - **Wireless**: Cisco WLC and ten LAPs.

### **Implementation Notes**
0. General Notes :
   - For WLC, instead of connecting to any of MLS that will limit redundancy , we will connect WLC to Switch and this witch will be connected to both HSRB
   - For MLS, sometimes is missing FastEither Ports , you must add manually 
   - Will implementing this topology be smart and prepare a chunck of some combined devices and then copy paste to another and also config this end devices ( printer , pc , ..etc ) to use DHCP and power on and other primitive settings
   - ALso while working on this topology, use fixing ports for specific tasks, this will also make the config easier :
		So for example here : in access layer switches from:
			Port 1-2 --> For MLS 
			port 3-15 --> LAN / Wired Devices 
			port 16 - 20 --> ArcGIS Enterprise Vlans ( App , webserver , data , database & serverside )
			Port 21-24 --> Access Points / WLAN 

1. **Challenges**:
   - Ensuring user growth projections are supported without performance degradation.
   - Managing separate segments for LAN, WLAN, and VoIP securely.
   - Maintaining redundancy in case of component failure.

2. **Key Considerations**:
   - Each department requires sufficient bandwidth, especially for guest WLAN traffic.
   - Secure access to AWS cloud services for developers and healthcare applications.
   - Compliance with healthcare standards for data security and privacy.

### **Configuration Steps**
1. **Initial Device Setup**:
   - Assign hostnames and secure devices with strong passwords and encrypted configurations.
   - Disable IP domain lookup and configure console and SSH access.

2. **VLAN Configuration**:
   - Create VLANs for LAN (VLAN 10), WLAN (VLAN 50), and VoIP (VLAN 99).
   - Assign ports to their respective VLANs on switches.

3. **Subnetting**:
   - WLAN: 10.10.0.0/16
   - LAN: 192.168.0.0/20
   - Voice: 172.16.0.0/20
   - DMZ: 10.20.20.0/26

4. **Routing**:
   - Configure inter-VLAN routing on the core multilayer switch.
   - Enable OSPF on routers and firewall for dynamic route advertising.
   - Assign static IPs to the server room devices.

5. **Wireless Configuration**:
   - Set up the Wireless LAN Controller and ten Lightweight Access Points.
   - Assign IPs dynamically via DHCP for WLAN devices.

6. **Security Policies**:
   - Configure ACLs to permit SSH access only for the senior engineer's PC.
   - Set inspection policies and define zones on the Cisco ASA Firewall.

7. **Redundancy**:
   - Implement HSRP for failover routing capabilities.
   - Use EtherChannel with LACP for aggregated links.

8. **Testing**:
   - Validate VLAN communication and interconnectivity.
   - Test failover scenarios and routing protocol convergence.
   - Verify VoIP services with dial plans in the format (3...).

### **Observations and Recommendations During Implementation**
- Regularly test backup systems and failover mechanisms to minimize downtime risks.
- Monitor bandwidth usage on WLAN to prevent congestion due to guest or corporate user activity.
- Document all configurations, especially OSPF and firewall policies, for reference during troubleshooting.
- Consider future integration of AI-driven network monitoring for proactive issue detection.
