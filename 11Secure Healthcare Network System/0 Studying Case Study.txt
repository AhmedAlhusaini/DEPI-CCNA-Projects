Always begin with studying case studies, gathering requirements to determine conceptual & Logical design.
Determine layers of design & technology of each layer.

Also Determine the VLANs, Subnets, physical design, servers & Network components specs & types

IPs, CIDR , Private & Public IPs  => IP Ranges & number of Users

What kind of services that will be available in this network infrastructure 
Categorize VLANs / Services

		2 Catalyst 3850 (48-Port)
		8 Catalyst 2960 (48-Port)
		2 Catalyst 2960 (24-Port)
	Routing:
		Cisco WAN Router (also supports VoIP traffic).
		OSPF for dynamic route advertisement.

	Wireless Connectivity: Managed via Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) and 10 Lightweight Access Points (LAPs).
	Voice Infrastructure: Cisco Voice Gateways deployed for VoIP and telephony.
	Redundancy: LACP EtherChannel and HSRP implemented.


4. Servers System Components and Services
	Server Hardware:
		2 HP ProLiant DL38 Gen10 servers (failover enabled).
		Virtualization through VMWare ESXi.

	Internal Virtual Machines:
		Red Hat Directory Server: Manages LDAP directory, DNS, and DHCP services.
		Health Information System (HIS).
		Email Server.
		File Server.

	Storage Devices:
		Two NetApp storage devices for efficient data management.


5. Cloud System Components and Services
	Platform: AWS Cloud
		Core Functions:
			Hosts the healthcare system for global accessibility.
			Supports developers and cloud engineers for application continuity and deployment.
			Ensures seamless scalability of business processes.


6. Security System Components & Services and Policies
	Firewall:
		Cisco ASA 5500-X series.
		Configured with zones, security levels, and inspection policies.

	Access Controls: Standard ACL for SSH (only Senior Network Security Engineerâ€™s PC is allowed via VTY).
	Segmentation: Separate network segments for LAN, WLAN, and VoIP users.
	Protocols: BPDUguard and PortFast to enhance Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) performance.

7. Subnetting & VLANs Details
	Subnetting:
		WLAN: 10.10.0.0/16
		LAN: 192.168.0.0/20
		Voice: 172.16.0.0/20
		DMZ: 10.20.20.0/26

	VLAN IDs:
		VLAN 10: LAN (internal devices and departments).
		VLAN 50: WLAN (guests, auditors, corporate users).
		VLAN 99: VoIP (telephony).

8. Public & Private IPs for All Ranges
Purpose			IP Address Range		Type
WLAN			10.10.0.0/16			Private
LAN			192.168.0.0/20			Private
Voice			172.16.0.0/20			Private
DMZ			10.20.20.0/26			Private
Public Services		197.200.100.0 (allocated)	Public

9. Notes, Recommendations, and Other Considerations
Scalability: Account for the anticipated doubling of users by ensuring sufficient IPs and bandwidth.
Redundancy: Include additional failover links and redundant network hardware.
Future Technologies: Monitor and integrate AI-driven network management systems for predictive maintenance.
Testing: Continuously test configurations, especially OSPF and ASA policies, to ensure compliance.
Documentation: Maintain thorough and up-to-date documentation of all configurations and subnetting schemes.

10. Basic Settings and Overall Configuration
	Hostnames, passwords, and banner messages configured for all devices.
	Password encryption and IP domain lookup disabled to streamline operations.
	Testing completed to ensure inter-VLAN routing, connectivity, and overall functionality.



Finally Any ESRI Modification will not be mentioned Here , ^-^ but upon need and configs as you will see later , Good Luck
