Then STP Will deal with this new group as one port. so you will have to enable port - channel , port mode , ...etc

int ra fa0/2-24
switchport mode trun
do wr



int ra fa0/11-15
channel-group 1 mode active 
int port-channel 1
switchport mode trunk 
ex
do wr




Also Voice Gateway should be trunk either as vlan of data and voice.
