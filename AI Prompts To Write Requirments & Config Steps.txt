	* Highlight risks, future recommendations, and scalability paths "

### **Site Location**: Identify company name, headquarters, and branch locations , floors and others to be able to imagine logical design .
*"List all floors, departments, and their network requirements (users, VLANs, devices) from the case study. Include any special arrangements like server rooms or wireless coverage needs."*  

   - Company Name: [Provide the company's name]
   - Headquarters: [Mention the primary headquarters location]
   - Branch Locations: [List any branch locations, if applicable] 
   - Special Requirements: [VoIP, WiFi, Cloud Integration, DMZ, etc.] and Special Requests: [Any unique needs, like smart devices, IoT, CCTV integration]
   - Staff Size: [e.g., 300 users]
   - Target Cloud Provider: [AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.] 



### **Requirements Extraction:**
*"List all explicit and implicit requirements from the case study, categorized as follows:
	- Business Requirements: Scalability (e.g., doubling users by 2025), centralized IT management, secure remote access.
	- Technical Requirements:
		-Hardware: Cisco ASA 5500-X firewalls, Catalyst 3850/2960 switches, WLC, IP phones, physical servers. , routers, switches, firewalls, servers, storage devices, etc.

		- Software: count needed and mentioned and description for the project like  Hypervisor for virtualization, Google Cloud integration, OSPF routing.hypervisors, operating systems, cloud platforms, etc.

		- Protocols & configurations : VLANs (10/20/50/199), OSPF, HSRP, LACP, IPsec VPN. VLAN IDs, routing protocols, security policies, etc.

		- Security: Firewall zones, ACLs for SSH, BPDUguard, STP PortFast.

		- User Demands: anticipated growth, scalability, or redundancy requirements. 30,000+ users, VoIP services, WiFi coverage per department."*
	- Subnetting & Vlans in simple table with text formate so i can copy paste simply like this : 
		 Function    | **Network** | Subnet Mask / like 24 ,..etc Formate  & 255.... Formate| VLAN ID | IP Range/Subnet  | USer Count | Other Information |
		|------------|-------------|-------------|  
		| Management | `192.168.10.0/24` | VLAN 10 | 

### **Implementation Notes & Constraints**
	- Constraints: related to the project requirements like 100-mile distance between campuses, reliance on IPsec VPN for connectivity, separate subnets per campus.

	- Risks: Single ISP dependency (Airtel), potential VLAN sprawl, DMZ security exposure.

	- Key Considerations: *network segmentation, redundancy plans, or security measures

		- Redundancy: HSRP for gateway failover, dual DHCP servers.

		- Segmentation: Strict LAN/WLAN/VoIP/DMZ separation.

		- Scalability: /16 subnets allow growth; recommend SD-WAN for future VPN optimization.

		- Challenges: Configuring inter-VLAN routing on multilayer switches, ensuring QoS for VoIP."*
	- Document how **user needs and scalability** will impact the implementation process.
	- Mention observations about **challenges or practicalities** during setup and operation.


### **Configuration Steps:**

- Mention and suggest based on the context ; device-specific settings such as hostnames, console passwords, encryption, etc.
- Describe testing procedures to verify configurations and ensure functionality.
- Detail the step-by-step process for configuring hardware, software, and network components.
  - Example: Setting up VLANs, assigning IP addresses, configuring routing protocols.
  - **IP Addressing**: Subnet allocation for WLAN, LAN, DMZ, VoIP, etc.
  - **VLAN Setup**: Assigning and configuring VLAN IDs across departments.
  - **Device Configuration**: Setting hostnames, passwords, banners, and encryption.
  - **Routing Protocols**: Dynamic routing setup (e.g., OSPF) on routers and switches.
  - **Security Policies**: Implementing firewalls, ACLs, zones, and inspection rules.
  - **Testing Procedures**: Ensure proper functionality through connectivity tests, inter-VLAN communication tests, and failover trials.
- Include device-specific configurations, e.g.,:
  - Setting DHCP servers for dynamic IP assignments.
  - Configuring STP PortFast and BPDUguard for efficient performance.
  - Enabling EtherChannel aggregation using LACP for link redundancy.



### **Observations and Recommendations During Implementation:**
4. Observations & Recommendations
	- Adjustments Made:  Note any **adjustments or unexpected challenges** faced during configuration.

		-Used firewall-based routing instead of dedicated routers.

		-Implemented /16 subnets for future growth despite initial overkill.

	-Best Practices:Provide **best practices** for optimizing scalability, performance, and security.

		-Standardized VLAN IDs across campuses.

		-Enabled password encryption and SSH-only access.

	-Future Enhancements & Recommendation: Recommend any **future enhancements**, such as integrating AI-driven network monitoring systems or adding more redundancy links.
		- **Immediate**: Enable logging on ASA for VPN monitoring.  
		- **Future**: Evaluate SD-WAN to replace IPsec.  
		- Mention Why for each step simply 
		- Structured: Forces AI to categorize data logically.
		- Actionable: Provides CLI snippets for real-world implementation.
		- Risk-Aware: Highlights constraints and mitigation strategies.

	-Documentation:  Emphasize the importance of **maintaining thorough documentation** for all configurations and system changes.

5. Validation Testing Plan ; *"Create a test plan to verify with expected results upon given scenairos.

	- Inter-VLAN Communication: Ping from Faculty A (VLAN 20) to Faculty B (VLAN 20).
	- VPN Connectivity: Transfer files between campuses via IPsec tunnel.
	- DHCP Functionality: Verify lease assignment from 10.10.1.10/16 pool.
	- Failover Tests: Disable primary HSRP switch, confirm backup takes over.
	- Security Checks: Ensure ACL blocks SSH from unauthorized IPs."*
