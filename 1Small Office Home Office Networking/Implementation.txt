1. Design Topology
2.Analyze Given Network Addresses 
	#Check Subnetting 
		@How Many Subnets 
		@How Many Networks
		@Determine N Part Vs H Part
	# How Many Departments  

Base Network Address:  192.168.40.0
No Of Subnets / Networks : 2

2^n=no of subnets ==> 2^n=2
N=1
255.255.255.255
11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000 => Then Convert these to deciemal 
255.255.255.128==This  is our subnet mask 

So, 

1st Subnet :
	Mask 	  : 255.255.255.128    /25
	Network ID: 192.168.40.0
	Valid Range Of Valid Host : 192.168.40.1 To 192.168.40.126
	BroadCast Id: 192.168.40.127
	

2nd Subnet :
	Mask 	  : 255.255.255.254
	Network ID: 192.168.40.128    /25
	Valid Range Of Valid Host : 192.168.40.129 To 192.168.40.254
	BroadCast Id: 192.168.40.255
