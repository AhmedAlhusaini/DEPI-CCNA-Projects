### Configuring FTPS with Security & Encryption Features  
FTPS (FTP Secure) is an extension of FTP that adds SSL/TLS encryption to secure file transfers. Here’s how to configure it on Windows Server using IIS (Internet Information Services):

#### 1. Install the FTP Server Role
- Open Server Manager → Click Add Roles and Features.
- Select Web Server (IIS) → Expand FTP Server.
- Enable FTP Service and FTP Extensibility.
- Click Install.

#### 2. Configure an FTPS Site
- Open IIS Manager → Click Sites → Add FTP Site.
- Set the Physical Path (where files will be stored).
- Assign an IP Address and Port (21 for FTP, 990 for FTPS).

#### 3. Enable SSL/TLS Encryption
- In IIS Manager, go to FTP SSL Settings.
- Select Require SSL (to enforce encryption).
- Choose an SSL Certificate (either self-signed or from a trusted CA).
- Click Apply.

#### 4. Configure User Authentication & Permissions
- Go to FTP Authentication → Enable Basic Authentication.
- In FTP Authorization Rules, allow access to specific users or groups.
- Set Read/Write permissions for secure file access.

#### 5. Configure Firewall & Passive Mode
- Open Windows Firewall → Allow FTP Server.
- In IIS, set Passive Mode Ports (e.g., 5000-5100).
- Ensure FTP over TLS is enabled.

#### 6. Test FTPS Connection
- Use an FTPS client like FileZilla.
- Connect using Explicit FTPS (AUTH TLS) or Implicit FTPS (Port 990).
- Verify secure file transfers.
