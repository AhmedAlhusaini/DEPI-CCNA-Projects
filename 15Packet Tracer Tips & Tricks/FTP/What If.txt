Now, I have configured the FTP server, successfully uploaded a file, and retrieved that file on another PC.  

What happens if multiple users edit the file simultaneously, or if I update the file?

### Answering Your Question  
When dealing with concurrent file editing or file updates, FTP does not have built-in file locking or version control, so hereâ€™s what happens:

#### 1. Multiple Users Editing the Same File at the Same Time  
- No Live Collaboration: FTP is a file transfer protocol, not a live collaborative tool like Google Docs or Git.
- Overwrite Issues: If multiple users download and edit the same file simultaneously, the last user to upload (put) the file will overwrite all previous versions without warning.
- Risk of Data Loss: If users don't communicate, previous edits can be lost when the file is overwritten.

#### 2. Updating the File  
- When you update the file and upload it (`put` command), it replaces the existing version on the FTP server.
- There is no version history unless you manually create backup copies before updating.

### Solutions to Prevent Issues  
- Use File Locking: Some advanced FTP servers support file locking to prevent simultaneous edits.
- Enable Version Control: Use external tools like Git or a version-controlled document system to track changes.
- Communication Matters: Make sure users coordinate file edits before uploading to avoid overwriting.
