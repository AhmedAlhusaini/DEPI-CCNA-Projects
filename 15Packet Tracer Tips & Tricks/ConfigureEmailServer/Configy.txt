Setting up an email server in Cisco Packet Tracer involves configuring a server with the necessary email services and ensuring communication with the connected devices. Follow these steps to configure and test an email server:

### Configuration Steps:
1. Set Up the Server
   - Click on the Server in Packet Tracer.
   - Navigate to the Services tab.
   - Select Email from the available services.

2. Configure SMTP and POP3 Services
   - Enable SMTP (for sending emails).
   - Enable POP3 (for receiving emails).
   - Set the domain name (e.g., `mail.local`).
   - Create user accounts with usernames and passwords.

3. Configure IP Address for the Server
   - Go to the Config tab.
   - Set a Static IP Address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).
   - Configure the Default Gateway (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).

4. Set Up the PCs
   - Click on PC1 and PC2.
   - Navigate to the Desktop tab.
   - Open Email Application.
   - Configure account settings:
     - SMTP server: `192.168.1.100`
     - POP3 server: `192.168.1.100`
     - Username and password.


- Outgoing Mail Server: This is typically SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), which is responsible for sending emails from your device to the recipient's mail server.
- Incoming Mail Server: This can be either POP3 (Post Office Protocol) or IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol).  
  - POP3 downloads emails to your device, usually removing them from the server.  
  - IMAP keeps emails on the server so you can access them from multiple devices.  

So, if you're looking at your email settings, your Outgoing Mail Server would be SMTP, and your Incoming Mail Server would be either IMAP or POP3, depending on your email provider's configuration.

5. Testing the Setup
   - On PC1, send an email to PC2.
   - Check whether PC2 receives the email.
   - Reply from PC2 and confirm successful communication.

### Troubleshooting:
- Ensure the server's IP settings match the network configuration.
- Confirm that email services are properly enabled.
- Check firewalls or security settings that might block traffic.

When you send an email from PC1 to PC2, several processes take place behind the scenes. Hereâ€™s a simplified breakdown of what happens:

### 1. PC1 Sends the Email
- The email client on PC1 connects to the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server you configured.
- PC1 authenticates with the server using the credentials you provided.
- The email is packaged into a data format and forwarded to the SMTP server.

### 2. SMTP Server Processes the Email
- The SMTP server checks the recipient's domain (PC2's email address).
- If it's local (i.e., within the same network), the server directly stores the email in the POP3/IMAP mailbox for PC2.
- If it's meant for an external network, the SMTP server forwards it to another mail server via the internet.

### 3. PC2 Receives the Email
- PC2â€™s email client connects to the POP3 or IMAP server and checks for new messages.
- POP3 downloads the email to PC2, while IMAP keeps the email on the server for access from multiple devices.
- The email appears in PC2â€™s inbox, ready for the user to read.

### Testing & Verification
After sending the email, PC2 should be able to:
- Open the email client.
- See the new message in the inbox.
- Reply to or forward the message as needed.

If the email isn't received, you may need to check:
- SMTP and POP3/IMAP settings.
- Firewall or network restrictions.
- User authentication details.
