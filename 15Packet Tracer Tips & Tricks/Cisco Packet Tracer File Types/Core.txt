Cisco Packet Tracer File Types & Differences


Cisco Packet Tracer supports four different file types, each serving a unique purpose:

1. .pka – Packet Tracer Activity File
Used in learning activities.

Includes instructions and scoring for students.

Contains two networks: Initial Network (visible) & Answer Network (hidden for scoring).

2. .pkt – Packet Tracer Network File
Saves custom-built simulated networks.

No scoring or instructions included.

Allows background images to be embedded.

3. .pksz – Packet Tracer Tutored Activity File
Specific to Packet Tracer Tutored Activities (PTTA).

Bundles a .pka file, media assets, and hinting scripts for guided learning.

4. .pkz – Compressed Packet Tracer File
A compressed version of .pkt or .pka files.

Helps reduce file size for easy sharing.
