   for example in case of floors 
   - Floor 1: [Describe which departments and components are on this floor, number of users, and VLAN details]
   - Floor 2: [Describe which departments and components are on this floor, number of users, and VLAN details]
   - Floor 3: [Describe which departments and components are on this floor, number of users, and VLAN details]
   - Additional Notes: [Include any specific features or arrangements per floor]

3. **Network System Components and services **: List switches, routers, wireless infrastructure, VoIP, and redundancy features.
   - Switching Hardware: [List types of switches and their roles]
   - Routing Hardware: [Mention routers and protocols used, such as OSPF]
   - Wireless Infrastructure: [Provide details on Wireless Access Points and the Wireless LAN Controller]
   - VoIP Services: [Describe VoIP components such as IP phones and Voice Gateways]
   - Redundancy Features: [Include technologies like EtherChannel and HSRP] 
   - List the network hardware used (e.g., switches, routers, access points).
   - Include protocols and technologies deployed (e.g., routing protocols, VLANs, EtherChannel).
   - Outline wireless network infrastructure and any VoIP systems.

 
4. **system compoenents "Servers & Services" **: Detail server hardware, virtualization, hosted services (DNS/DHCP), and storage.
   - Server Hardware: [Specify the servers used and their configurations]
   - Virtualization: [Describe the hypervisors and virtual machine functions]
   - Hosted Services: [List internal services like DNS, DHCP, email, and file sharing]
   - Storage Solutions: [Mention storage hardware and configurations] 
 
5. **Cloud System compoenent and services **: Specify cloud platforms (e.g., AWS/Azure) and services used. 
   - Cloud Platform: [Indicate the platform used, such as AWS or Azure]
   - Cloud Services: [Explain the core cloud functionalities, such as application hosting or business continuity] 
6. **Security system compoenet and services **: Describe firewalls, ACLs, segmentation, and additional protections (BPDUguard, etc.). 
*"Extract all security measures mentioned (firewalls, ACLs, VPNs) and propose additional protections (e.g., IDS/IPS) based on industry best practices. Highlight segmentation policies."*  

   - Firewall: [Provide details on the type of firewall and its configuration]
   - Access Control: [Mention ACLs and secure access policies]
   - Network Segmentation: [Describe segmentation for LAN, WLAN, and VoIP]
   - Additional Security Features: [Include any other security measures like BPDUguard or monitoring protocols]

 
7. **Subnetting/VLANs**: Provide IP ranges for WLAN, LAN, Voice, DMZ, and VLAN IDs. 
   - WLAN Subnet: [Provide the IP range allocated]
   - LAN Subnet: [Provide the IP range allocated]
   - Voice Subnet: [Provide the IP range allocated]
   - DMZ Subnet: [Provide the IP range allocated]
   - VLANs: [List VLAN IDs and their corresponding functions]
 
8. **Public and Private IP Addressin**: List public/private IP ranges.
   - WLAN IP Range: [Provide the range]
   - LAN IP Range: [Provide the range]
   - Voice IP Range: [Provide the range]
   - DMZ IP Range: [Provide the range]
   - Public IP Range: [Provide the range]

  
9. **Additional Notes, Recommendations, and Observations**: Cover scalability, redundancy, future tech, and documentation.  
   - Scalability: [Mention plans or recommendations for scaling up]
   - Redundancy: [Include recommendations for ensuring redundancy]
   - Future Technologies: [Suggest any emerging technologies to consider]
   - Performance Testing: [Note testing results or future plans]
   - Documentation: [Recommend maintaining updated documentation]

10. **Configuration**: Summarize hostnames, passwords, inter-VLAN routing, and testing results. 
Here i need to devided into basic configs for all devices 
and specific confis for each group of devices 
	#Core Switches 
	#MLS
	#Router
	#ISP ROuter
	#Firewall 
	#VoIP Router 
and Others 
11. Verification & Testing Prompt**  
*"Generate a step-by-step testing plan to validate:  
- Inter-VLAN routing.  
- Site-to-site VPN connectivity.  
- DHCP/DNS functionality.  
- Firewall rule effectiveness.  
Include expected outcomes and troubleshooting steps."*  

also write the logical order of configuring and implement all configs in the case study / project
